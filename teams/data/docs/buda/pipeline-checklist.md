# Buffer Unified Data Pipeline Checklist

Each pipeline should ideally follow a set of rules that will help us maintaining these.

### General

Preferably, the pipelines will be self-contained in a repository with a clear **Maintainer**. The Maintainer will take care of making sure that documentation is up to date and the rest of the checklist items are implemented.

Since each pipeline will be in its own repository, the **README** file should be the source of truth for:

- The Pipeline Overview
- Approach and Components
- Development Setup
- Deployment and Tests
- Monitoring and Logging
- Maintainer
