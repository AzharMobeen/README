# What does it mean to be data driven?

Being data driven means acting on data. A data driven culture is one that uses data to make decisions. It is more than having data to validate or invalidate hunches -- data should drive action.

In order to get there we need the right tooling, ability, and culture. That requires a high bar of trust in the data and the tools (and the analysts.)

## Prerequisites for data driven orgs

- The org has to be collecting data. The data must be timely, accurate, clean, unbiased, and trustworthy. Our data is timely, but I wouldn't say it's completely accurate, clean, or trustworthy just yet.
- The team must have access to the data. This is where Liger comes in. The team needs to have access to accurate, timely, and relevant data.
- The org must be reporting key metrics. We're doing this already. The reported numbers are just numbers with little to no context.
- The org must have alerting in place. We have this to some degree in some teams, particularly the engineering team. We have some alerting sporadically around the team around usage metrics, but not much.

### Forward- Looking Analysis

Buffer has the prerequisites, however those aren't enough to call ourselves data-driven. Reporting tells us what happened in the past and alerting tells us what is happening now, but we need analysis to be forward looking.  Additionally analysis is required to really dig in and find why numbers change and make testable predictions.

### Hallmarks of being data driven

Several activities that data driven orgs do:

- Continuous testing. This can be simple A/B testing, which we do!
- Continuous improvement mindset. This can mean repeated optimization of core processes and comes through analysis, creating statistical models and simulation.
- Involved in predictive modeling, forecasting, and **feeding prediction errors and other learning into models to improve them**.
- Making decisions using a combination of weighted variables. Decision makers should be able to gather data for each set of variable outcomes that are of interest and determine weights for those.

**Data needs to be a first-class citizen**. It shouldn't just be used to find out why something in the past happened. That requires investment in forward-looking analysis and, importantly, buy-in from decision makers.

### Where are we now?

Below are eight stages of analytic maturity as defined by Jim Davis. I believe that Buffer is somewhere in between step 4 and 5.

1. Standard reports: what happened? when did it happen?
1. Ad hoc reports: how man? how often? where?
1. Query drill down: where exactly is the problem? how do I find the answer?
1. Alerts: when should I react? what actions are needed?
1. Statistical analysis/inference: why is this happening? what opportunities are we missing?
1. Forecasting: what if these trends continue?
1. Predictive modeling: what will happen next? how will this affect the business?
1. Optimization: how do we do things better? what is the best decision?
