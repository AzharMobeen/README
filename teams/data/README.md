## How We Work

We work in 6-week cycles. We have a [list of pitches](https://paper.dropbox.com/project/show/Data-Team-Pitches-e.iX7ZavGxujPFwhjOZcQs9BG6Wivo9snbyKnQdWAtyh3KmMHZWU) that reflects our roadmap. Pitches are ideas of new features, changes to existing features, or any other product development we think it should be considered.

The next sections will give an overview of the processes and tools we use to work, plan and communicate.
