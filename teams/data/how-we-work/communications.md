# Communications

We're a distributed, remote team that rely on asynchronous communication and are as open as we can. We prefer issues or public chat channels over direct messages or meetings.

## Paper

Paper is a document editor in the cloud that allow us to collaboratively author and discuss **fast-changing** documents. We use Paper for frequently adapted / customized documents or documents that won't be relevant in the future.

### Tips

- If you're using a Paper document as an important reference, think on moving it to Github. This gives more granular control over edits via pull requests.
- Flag outdated or deprecated documents in the title using appending `[DEPRECATED]`
- You can tag documents using `#hashtags` inside Paper. You can then get Papers containing specific `#hashtags` using the search bar.

## Discourse

We use Discourse for high-level announcements, data questions or cross team collaborations.

### Tips

- We have a [Data section](https://discourse.buffer.com/c/teams/data-looker).

## GitHub

GitHub allows us to collaborate and work asynchronously.

### Tips

- Besides technical discussion, we use issues as a way to ask questions and keep the conversations focused.
