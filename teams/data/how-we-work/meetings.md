# Meetings

We have meetings serving different purposes. Some part of the meetings discussion should have already taken place in related issues. This encourages asynchronous discussions before and after the meetings.

## Retrospectives

Each week, we have a one hour call reflecting on how can we improve our processes and challenges we've encountered. We go through the points:

1. What was epic?
1. What could be epic if we try it?
1. Blockers/Unplanned Work Signals
1. Next Steps

Team members are encouraged to add thoughts for the next meeting as soon as they can, creating the document if it wasn't created before using the [retrospective template](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Data-Team-Retrospective-Week-TEMPLATE-8WPdqxrfQRRSk0nUbjY2o). Ideally, points under the last two questions should have a link to their respective issues in this repository to promote further discussion.

Notes are available in the [Data Team Retrospectives](https://paper.dropbox.com/project/show/Data-Team-Retrospectives-e.iX7ZavGxujPFwhjOZcQs9wNhzSDfwy0nDovtfAxd5Gw5knuXbc) Paper folder with the format `Data Team Retrospective Week WEEK-NUMBER`.
