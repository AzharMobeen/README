# Working with Data

 Set of guidelines and best practices to make working with data easy for everyone.

## Best Practices

- Data is only useful as long as itâ€™s being used.
- Think of the data state as a sieries of inmutable events. that means trating all the data as an event log. Consumers can subscribe to the relevant event log. Having a central place (the log) for continuous events make easy to create a stream of data to process and sets a source of truth.
- Use UTF-8 encoding in all the strings.
- `None` should represent missing or empty values. For example, for a `likes` field the default value should be `0`, `None` should be used in case this information is not available.
- Avoid empty strings except if they're required in a particular field. Use `null`/`None` instead.
- Use [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) date (`YYYY-MM-DD`) and time (`hh:mm:ss`) formats when possible (even when writing documents).
- Deprecate or remove old resources (database tables, code, streams). To deprecate, rename the old resource and not the new one. For example, if a new updates table is added, call it `updates` and rename the old one to something like `updates_old_[date]` if it can't be deleted.

## Naming Conventions

- Follow [Looker Naming Convention](https://looker.buffer.com/stories/liger/naming_conventions.md) for SQL.
