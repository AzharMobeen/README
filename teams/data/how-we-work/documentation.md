# Documentation

Documentation is part of what makes any resource awesome. Here are some tips to make awesome documentation!

- Follow a [Readme Driven Development](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html), thath means first writting a [good README](https://gist.github.com/PurpleBooth/109311bb0361f32d87a2) file and then start working on what's written.
- Write examples before definitions.
- Mark documents (Papers, Discourse) as deprecated adding `[DEPRECATED]` to the title if you notice they're now longer accurate.
- Document conventions as soon as you notice a fragmentation signal. Aim to keep as much consistency as you can (variable naming, default values, column types).
