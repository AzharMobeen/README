# Engineering Career Paths FAQ

### What does the “Expected Timeframe to Next Step” mean?
The expected timeframe is not a requirement. This is a general timeframe to give some context to how quickly we expect someone to progress on their career journey. If someone takes extra care of their journey, they could possibly move forward along the career path sooner than the timeframe, but this might be a rare case too. Especially for ownership, a key component is showing consistency and to display that trust over time. This could only come about through time.

The expected timeframe also gives us an idea to figure out and understand if someone is not progressing, why this could be.

The timeframes are not cumulative, but rather are a guide to move from one step to the next one.

### Do Staff engineers need to be generalists? 
The definition of staff engineer has got a generalist in mind at this point, but that doesn’t mean a specialist/craftsperson could not become a staff engineer. It is still possible (although more difficult) for specialists to impact multiple teams or areas through their work, without going “wider” in our tech stack. For example, building tools or libraries for different projects and championing their use in other teams through open source would be a way to do that as a craftsperson. 

This route is likely to be a slower one than the generalist route though, likely first becoming “Senior Engineer II”, because it will likely take more work for a specialist to have the same scope influence as a strong generalist. It doesn’t mean you can’t do it 😃  Just because the framework encourages development of strong T-shaped generalist engineers, does not mean that there is no way for a expert craftsperson to grow further.

We’ll also be looking into expanding our framework in the next few months to take into account more freedom in the craftsperson paths beyond senior engineer. Whether this translates into separate staff engineer paths (craftsperson or generalist) or look slightly different, we are not 100% sure yet.

### What happens if I don’t have a chance to work in the way described by the next stage in the career path framework? 
You can express the “way work is conducted” outside of Buffer - “area” can also be your technical area of expertise. For example, someone who works on a team of 1 (alone) but who writes tutorials, has a great technical blog and gives snackchats would be fulfilling. 

> Gives guidance & unblocks others on their team/area

We’d also love to encourage active discussions with your manager/mentor about how you can take on projects and stretch goals to lean more into working in the way the next stage on the career path framework is described. So, for example, to progress along your journey to Senior, you would need to start working like a Senior Engineer.

### If a service or app already has an owner, does that mean I can’t fully own it? Can there only be one “real” owner?
No. There can (and ideally should be) more than one full owner, especially for core areas. The ownership you show is determined by your own context and behaviour, and not by what others do (or don’t do).

### How can new hires be Senior and above, if they haven’t got a “strong record of Ownership” at Buffer? 
The “strong record of ownership” does not have to be shown at Buffer. So if a new engineer joins and has shown strong ownership in previous jobs or projects, then that criterion is met. The ownership expectations for a new hire at a senior and above, are very high though, so it does mean a quicker ramping up period is expected to gain the context to have that strong record at Buffer as well.

### Are we expecting to have a limit on the number of engineers at each role?
There is no hard limit on the number of people at any one place in their journey. If you are described by the next stage on the career framework, then whether or not there are already many people working in that way does not affect your own promotion. The ideal numbers at each stage in the framework will be determined by Buffer’s needs and goals. Balancing the team to have the right numbers of engineers at each point on their career journeys will be supported by both hiring goals and by engineers growing in the future. There are no hard targets and no one will ever be prevented from progressing along their career path because of any numerical targets or limits 😃 

### When does promotion occur?
It should feel great to discuss your progress and any concerns regularly in your 1:1s, and you should always have a sense of where you’re at and what to work on. Conversations around how you are doing and growing are an important part of 1:1s and it’s great to bring up questions around promotion any time they occur to you 😃 
Your regular reviews from your manager and cycle goals should also support your growth and help you to focus on moving forward in your career. The recap and review each quarter provides a natural time to reflect more deeply with your manager on whether you might have progressed to a new stage in your journey yet, or what you can focus on the next quarter. 
In future, we may also consider doing more higher-level chats every six months to make sure everyone is still at a stage in their career path that feels great. 
These are just guidelines, and your growth should be an ongoing conversation with your manager/mentor. Since the process is ongoing, there is no special time of year when promotions have to be done.

### How does this relate to job titles? Will my title now change? 
Not necessarily - these descriptions are used to determine salary in the salary formula, the same way use “backend/frontend developer” say. But you don’t necessarily have “backend/fontend developer” on the Buffer team page or elsewhere. 

You’re free to either keep whatever current title you are using or switch to use the description at the framework if you prefer that. So for example, teammates might have titles like “Software Engineer”, “Engineer”, “Developer”, “Mobile Developer”, “iOS Developer” “Systems Engineer” - all of these are corresponding: Software Engineer/Software Engineer II/Software Engineer III. 

A Senior Engineer might keep their same title like “Product Engineering Lead”, or choose to go with the framework’s description of “Senior Engineer”. 

We’ll likely need to try standardize this a little in future and have more descriptive titles because “Software engineer” is used extremely broadly (covering all kinds of development from mobile to systems right now). Right now as a first iteration, we’re trying not to change all the things at once, and just start with bringing greater clarity to career growth and compensation/promotion. 

### How do Engineering Managers fit in? 
The Engineering Management track is a shorter track, branching off after Engineer III. We don’t yet have a framework for engineering managers, since there are relatively very few EMs.
