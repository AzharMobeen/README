## Core Accountabilities of Engineering Managers
**1. Engagement & Retention of Engineers**

Engineers are meeting their role expectations, have a healthy, supportive work environment, and are getting the encouragement, recognition and feedback needed to keep succeeding and to grow professionally.

**Examples of work in this area:**
[1-1s](/engineering-management/one-on-ones.md), career roadmaps, promotion motivations, team retros and learning syncs

**2. Delivery of the Product**

The team is productive, delivering software of an agreed quality standard, in a predictable and reasonable time frame.
(While “predictable and reasonable” is fuzzy, we are aiming for transparent, predictable work and are accountable to continuous learning to improve in a blame-free way where product delivery faces bottlenecks).

**Examples of work in this area:** 
Team cycle planning to get rough estimates, surfacing challenges that could hamper a team's ability to deliver, and cross-team dependency coordination and project management fall here.

## Core Accountabilities of Director of Engineering, Management
**1. People & Culture** 
Accountable to all aspects of engineering management, recruitment, retention and culture, so that we have a highly effective team that also demonstrates care for each individual’s personal development, career progression and mental wellbeing as a holistic individual.

**Examples of work in this area** 
Manager 1:1s, skip-level 1:1s, developing and iterating on [Career Path Frameworks](/engineering-management/career-path-framework.md), stewarding all aspects of engineering hiring and recruitment, and maintaining and furthering engineering-wide culture initiatives.

**2. Delivery & Operations**
Accountable to the overall engineering delivery on our product strategy and vision in a way that is timely, of product quality level chosen by product, and long-run sustainable for all engineering’s stakeholders and customers. Accountable to teams across engineering having the right types and amount of structure to work smoothly and transparently. _Our processes serve our people, our products and our customers_.

**Examples of work in this area:** 
Overall processes like how we prioritize large/complex cross-team projects, plan cycles, the tools we use across engineering, how we document decisions and share knowledge, and team growth planning fall here.
