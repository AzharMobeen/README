## Core Accountabilities of Engineering Managers
1. Engagement & Retention of Engineers
Engineers are meeting their role expectations, have a healthy, supportive work environment, and are getting the encouragement, recognition and feedback needed to keep succeeding and to grow professionally.

**Areas of work:** [1-1s](/engineering-management/one-on-ones.md), career roadmaps, promotion motivations, team retros and learning syncs

2. Delivery of the Product
The team is productive, delivering software of an agreed quality standard, in a predictable and reasonable time frame.
(While “predictable and reasonable” is fuzzy, Multiple Composers is a nice clear example of way off track when it comes to predictable & reasonable time frame and acceptable quality. We didn’t have an EM who’s been consistently involved there).

**Areas of work:** Team cycle planning to get rough estimates, surfacing challenges that could hamper a team's ability to deliver, and cross-team dependency coordination and project management fall here.

## Core Accountabilities of Director of Engineering, Management
1. People & Culture 
The Director oversees all aspects of engineering management, recruitment, retention and culture, so that we have a highly effective team that also demonstrates care for each individual’s personal development, career progression and mental wellbeing.

**Areas of work:** Manager 1:1s, skip-level 1:1s, [Career Path Framework](/engineering-management/career-path-framework.md), overseeing the hiring process, and engineering-wide culture initiatives fall here.

2. Delivery & Operations
The Director is accountable to the overall engineering delivery on our product strategy and vision in a way that is timely, of the chosen quality level, and long-run sustainable for all engineering’s stakeholders. They are accountable to teams across engineering having the right types and amount of structure to work smoothly and transparently. Our processes serve our people, our products and our customers.

**Areas of work:** Overall processes like how we prioritize large/complex cross-team projects, plan cycles, the tools we use, documenting decisions, and team growth planning fall here.
