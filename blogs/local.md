## Local Setup
We have previously made use of MAMP to host WordPress locally. Depending on how familiar you are with Docker, you could also setup a Docker Image with a WordPress environment.

You'll want the buffer-blog-themes repository checked out within the WordPress envirnment so the WordPress installation has access to the themes.

Once setup you can grab an export of the MySQL database from WPEngine via phpMyAdmin to work with real blog content.

You can find an old setup guide for setting the blogs up locally [here.](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/WordPress-Local-Setup-with-GitHub-Desktop-Gn1wCfDnOwhG80HTTVH2j)
