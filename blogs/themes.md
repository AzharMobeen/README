The buffer-blog-themes repository houses the current theme as well as previous themes that Buffer has used over the years. **buffer-2016** is in use across each of the sites right now.

### buffer-2016

The 2016 theme is a single theme that has various template options available within the WordPress theme options allowing it to be tailored for each individual blog. Including different homepage templates called "newspaper" and "magazine".

buffer-2016 makes use of GULP and SASS to compile & minify scripts and CSS.

As the theme is used across each site the theme contains logic to adjust the display slightly from site to site, most of this is configurable via the Theme Settings.

### Previous Themes
Previous themes made use of a base theme which was then overwritten by sub themes to customize them for each individual site.

Having one singular code base for each sites theme makes making changes across each of the blogs easier.
