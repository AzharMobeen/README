## Introduction

At Buffer, we use several methods to help deploy code as flexibly as possible. Given the number of environment types we deploy in, there are a fair number of possible commands depending on your use case. 

Most deployments currently run through Slack and are triggered via a Slackbot command. Newer services being developed are running through a CI/CD process that deploys to production whenever commits are added to the `master` branch of their corresponding repository.

## Production Deployments

The command to generate a new deployment to production is:

`@bufferbot deploy <environment>`

This command should be run in the `#eng-deploys` room in Slack. It triggers a build which deploys the latest commit in the `master` branch to a selected environment.

Buffer's current main codebase is structured as a monolith. Therefore it can be deployed to several environments. The environments available currently are as followed:

* `web`
* `api`
* `utils`
* ~~`utils-updates`~~ (DEPRECATED: The `update` workers are in Kubernetes now, [see here](https://github.com/bufferapp/README/blob/master/buffer-web-workers-kubernetes.md#production-deployments).)
* `cron`

The command currently accepts only a single environment at a time.

Example: `@bufferbot deploy web`

Prior to deployment, do a quick check with the team using `@here ok for deploy to <environment>?` message. This is in case anyone has done a deployment and is still monitoring for any regressions or in case someone is about to do a deployment of their own and needs to get it out asap. In the future we'll be able to automate this away. If you get some `+1` emoji reactions or no replies after about 5 minutes at most, feel free to deploy.

## Staging Deployments

Part of our development flow allows for staging servers. If you wish to test your work on the staging servers then the below flow is for you. 

**For testing changes to the API**

`@bufferbot deploy <branch> to dev-api`

Example: `@bufferbot deploy task/my-important-task to dev-api`

This command accepts `master` as a branch too. 

**For testing changes to the frontend/product itself**

`@bufferbot devdeploy <branch>`

To test changes that you would normally deploy to the `web` environment, we have a different approach. Buffer has 3 staging servers set up. The command `devdeploy` helps manage sharing these servers with each other.

Example: `@bufferbot devdeploy task/my-special-task` 

The above example will deploy the branch to one of our 3 staging servers and will reply with a message stating which server was used and which dev url you can find your deployment at. The machine it is deployed to is then locked to your name. The next time you do a `devdeploy` it will automatically redeploy to the same machine. If anyone else wishes to use that machine, they must explicity unlock it. Machines are automatically unlocked every 12 hours unless an explicit desire to have it locked for longer has been expressed.

There are other commands possible with `devdeploy`.

**Get the statuses of each dev machine:** `@bufferbot devdeploy status` 

**Unlock a machine you need or if you are done with it** `@bufferbot devdeploy unlock <dev1/dev2/dev3>`

The above command shows the choice of machines. If you wish to unlock `dev3` you'd use `@bufferbot devdeploy unlock dev3`

**Create a provisional lock on your machine** `@bufferbot devdeploy lock <dev1/dev2/dev3>`

In some cases, you might want to keep your dev environment around for longer than 12 hours. In that case you'd run this command. It gives you the choice of selecting of locking the machine for 24/36/48 hours. The choice is made directly through the slack interface.

**Deploying to a dev machine of your choice** `@bufferbot devdeploy <branch> to <dev1/dev2/dev3>`

NOTE: This is a USE ONLY IF YOU ABSOLUTELY MUST command. The logic behind this warning is that if you have a use case that depends on staging a deployment to particular machine, this is considered a code smell in many cases. That said, it's hart to avoid it 100% of the time. Therefore this command has been offered as an escape hatch.
